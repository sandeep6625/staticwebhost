# Static Website Deployment using CI/CD (Jenkins + AWS S3)

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website using a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and Amazon Web Services (AWS), including S3 for hosting.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automate the deployment of a static website using DevOps practices.  
Whenever code is updated in GitHub, Jenkins automatically builds and deploys the website to an AWS S3 bucket.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Git & GitHub  
- Jenkins (CI/CD Pipeline)  
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
- AWS S3 (Static Website Hosting)  
- AWS EC2 (for Jenkins setup)  
- Linux (Ubuntu / Amazon Linux)  
- HTML & CSS  

## ⚙️ Workflow Architecture
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub repository  
2. Jenkins automatically pulls the latest code  
3. Jenkins builds the project  
4. Jenkins deploys the website files to AWS S3 bucket  
5. Website becomes live via S3 static website hosting  

GitHub → Jenkins → AWS S3 → Live Website
